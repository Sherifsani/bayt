          . I am Sani Sherif, a student of knowledge and a lover of technology.
          I am a computer science major who is passionate about cloud computing
          and enjoys building scalable and efficient systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started out as a Frontend developer then transitioned to the cloud
          when I discovered the world of cloud computing. I am currently
          learning and building projects with AWS and have two certifications
          under my belt:
          <br />{" "}
          <span className="p-[.2rem] bg-slate-100 rounded-md">
            AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate
          </span>{" "}
          -{" "}
          <span className="p-[.2rem] bg-slate-100 rounded-md">
            AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
          </span>{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I've built a range of projects, from deploying secure
          WordPress sites on AWS via Terraform to developing dynamic,
          user-friendly applications using modern frameworks. My technical
          expertise spans across React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and AWS
          services like S3, ECS, Lambda, and Fargate.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me balancing my passion for
          technology with my devotion to faith (islam) and personal growth. I'm
          also an avid learner, currently deep-diving into DevOps practices and
          cloud engineering to expand my skill set further.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe that technology has the power to transform lives, and I'm on
          a mission to contribute by building impactful, scalable solutions.
          Whether it's creating seamless user experiences, writing insightful
          blogs, or sharing knowledge with the tech community, I aim to leave a
          mark that inspires others.
        </p>
